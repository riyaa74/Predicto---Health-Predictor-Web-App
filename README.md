Project for MPSTME students for the subject Web Programming.

## Name<br>
Predicto Heath App.

## Description<br>
“Predicto is an intelligent tool for Automatic Disease prediction made for you.We provide automatic diagnosis for a wide range of diseases , in addition to this we also have a symptom checking facility available for health checkup at the comfort of your homes !<br>
Each time you go through it and add your diagnosis or symptom, we enhance personalized health check-ups adjusted to your state. It is possible thanks to our AI-based diagnostic engine connected with our meticulous base of medical knowledge.”<br>
It is estimated that more than 70% of people in India are prone to general body diseases like viral, flu, cough, cold, pneumonia,  etc, regularly. Because many people don't realize that the general body diseases could be symptoms of something more harmful, 25 % of the population succumbs to death because of ignoring the early general body symptoms. This could be a dangerous situation for the population and can be alarming. Hence identifying or predicting the disease at the earliest is very important to avoid any unwanted casualties.<br>
Disease Prediction is a system which helps in predicting the diseases based on the information the user has provided and gives accurate results based on the symptoms the user has provided.<br>

## SCOPE<br>
This web app is developed using Flask Web Framework and MySQL Database. The models used to predict the diseases are trained on large Datasets. All the links for datasets and the python notebooks used for model creation are mentioned later. The webapp can predict following Diseases:<br>

Heart Disease<br>
Kidney Disease<br>
Liver Disease<br>
Malaria<br>
Pneumonia<br>
Disease based on Symptoms <br>
