It is estimated that more than 70% of people in India are prone to general body diseases like viral, flu, cough, cold, pneumonia,  etc, regularly. Because many people don't realize that the general body diseases could be symptoms of something more harmful, 25 % of the population succumbs to death because of ignoring the early general body symptoms. This could be a dangerous situation for the population and can be alarming. Hence identifying or predicting the disease at the earliest is very important to avoid any unwanted casualties.<br>
Disease Prediction is a system which helps in predicting the diseases based on the information the user has provided and gives accurate results based on the symptoms the user has provided.<br>
